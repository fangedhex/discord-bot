# Discord-Bot

This bot is used by me for my own "private" discord server.
Currently, it can only stream audio from Youtube
but later on, I will add more features to it.

Also, I'm trying to find a way to make working on Discord
and other platforms at the same time, without having to
much duplicated code.

Note : This repository is a mirror from my private
gitlab instance where the deployment part is done
automatically through Gitlab CI and private docker registry.
